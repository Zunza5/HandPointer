# HandPointer

HandPuntator is a Python-based system that enables hands-free computer control using real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition powered by MediaPipe, translating finger landmarks into precise cursor movement and configurable actions like clicking, dragging, and scrolling for accessible, touch-free interaction scenarios .

Key contributions
- Implemented robust real-time hand landmark tracking and gesture mapping with MediaPipe Tasks to support low-latency, smooth pointer control and discrete actions .
- 	Designed a modular input layer that maps index-finger kinematics to cursor motion and pinch-orientation gestures to clicks and drags, making behaviors easy to extend or swap .
-	Built an experimentation pipeline with OpenCV for video capture and visualization, enabling rapid iteration on gesture thresholds, smoothing, and UX tuning .
What it showcases

- Computer vision integration: applying MediaPipeâ€™s Gesture Recognizer/Hands pipeline to interface design and human-computer interaction .
-	Systems thinking: translating continuous hand pose data into stable, user-friendly controls through filtering, debouncing, and gesture state machines .
- Accessibility and HCI: enabling touch-free control for mobility and hygiene contexts, and prototyping alternative input methods .


## Run Locally

1: Clone the git repo and go to directory

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Zunza5/HandPointer.git
  cd HandPointer
```

2: Create and activate a virtual environment

macOS/Linux:

```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
```
windows:

```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ..venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3: Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4: run main.py

```bash
  python3 main.py
```
